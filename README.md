## Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a school project I did in the 13th grade.
The goal was to create a web-based tic-tac-toe game hosted on a web server that allows two players to play against each other.


## About
So the basic implementation is a python flask based web server and a html, bootstrap based frontend.
In addition to the basic requirements, I extended the project to support multiple game rooms, allowing simultaneous matches.
Communication between the client and web server during gameplay is facilitated using Socket.io.
The game is currently fully playable, and I have thoroughly tested the game. I have some additional ideas for future improvements that I may implement.
